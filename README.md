# CSCE676-DataMiningProject

Goal: Select a dataset that meaningfully supports one or more data mining techniques covered in this course AND at least one additional technique not covered in the course. We'll conduct a semester-long analysis with this dataset

I chose "Algorithmic Behaviors Across Regions: A Geolocation Audit of YouTube Search for COVID-19 Misinformation Between the United States and South Africa"
- Authors: Hayoung Jung, Prerna Juneja, Tanushree Mitra
